CFA Major Project 3
===================

Synopsis
========
The third major project for CFA was client based. My client's problem was that no money tracking application suited her needs. To help her, I decided to build her an money tracking app by using JavaScript and other frameworks. 

Design Process
==============

User Stories
------------
Using trello, my client and I came up with some of the user stories
